Amino acids are the building blocks of protein & help promote cell repair & renewal, as well as increase muscle strength & growth. Due to its amino-acid content, beef liver is also a source of complete protein. This means it helps maintain muscle mass, promotes tissue repair (which is super important if you work out often), recovery from exercise, controls appetite & produces & regulates healthy hormone levels.<\/p>",

You may be thinking – hey, can’t I get that from kale Vitamin K yes, but not MK-4, the type only found in animal foods. In fact, most people consuming a traditional Western diet get almost no vitamin K2. It’s necessary to note that the vitamin A in beef liver is in its most active form (retinol). This type of vitamin A only comes from animal-derived foods & does not need to be first converted like plant-based vitamin A (carotenoids), meaning that it’s ready to be used directly by the body. Vitamin A helps reduce inflammation by fighting free radical damage, helps with muscle recovery & builds strong bones.<\/p>",
